2017-01-10 v1.2
- bugfixes in tests with real data (coordinate systems of each dataset are now transformed individually, which fixed the performace issues of the following methods on real data: Mirzaei, RPnL, ASPnL, LPnL_Bar_LS, LPnL_Bar_ENull)
- minor update to DLT-Pl√ºcker-Lines and DLT-Combined-Lines: the choice of solution A/B is now based on whether the scene is in front of the camera, not on the similarity of the right rotation submatrix to the left rotation submatrix
- minor improvement in conversion of output in Ansar_wrapper: R_cw \ T_cw used instead of R_cw.' * T_cw, because R_cw may not be orthonormal in Ansar's method
- minor updates of README
